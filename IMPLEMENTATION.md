## Data Structures

### Five-Tuple Structure
```c
struct five_tuple {
    uint32_t src_ip;      // Source IP address
    uint32_t dst_ip;      // Destination IP address
    uint16_t src_port;    // Source port
    uint16_t dst_port;    // Destination port
    uint8_t proto;        // Protocol (TCP/UDP/etc.)
    uint8_t pad[3];       // Padding for alignment
} __rte_aligned(16);
```

### Filter Rule Structure
```c
struct filter_rule {
    struct five_tuple tuple;  // Matching criteria
    uint8_t action;          // Action to take
    uint8_t priority;        // Rule priority
    uint16_t rule_id;        // Unique identifier
    uint64_t hit_count;      // Statistics counter
    uint64_t last_hit_time;  // Last match timestamp
} __rte_aligned(64);
```

### Application Context
```c
struct app_context {
    struct rte_hash *rule_hash;           // Hash table
    struct filter_rule *rules;           // Rule storage
    struct rte_ring *rx_rings[RTE_MAX_LCORE]; // Inter-core rings
    struct rte_mempool *pktmbuf_pool;     // Packet memory pool
    struct lcore_stats stats[RTE_MAX_LCORE]; // Per-core stats
    // ... configuration and control fields
} __rte_cache_aligned;
```
